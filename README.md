## News
Currently, the first version of a graphical user interface for kids is being developed.

## Demonstration and Examples
Demonstrations and examples can be executed using `gradle`. A (somewhat) stable demonstration can be executed from the `master`-branch (see Main UI).

#### Main UI
The main UI provides the possibility to interact with the implemented logic directly. It can be started using

```shell
./gradlew :inforkids-ui:run
```
